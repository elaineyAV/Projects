# Projects

This repository contains selected works I have created since the beginning of my Computer Science journey in Fall 2024.

**Programs** : Coding projects that solve problems such as a Grade Calculator for professors to add students and input grades into specified categories, then output and store a final grade for each student into a file

**Technical Documents** : Documentation and guides I've written to explain CS concepts (particularly in Java) and to support students that I mentor as a Learning Assistant.
